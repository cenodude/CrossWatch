# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to CrossWatch.

## Current status

CrossWatch is in an early development stage and **we are not accepting external contributions at this time** (including pull requests).

This is temporary. The goal is to stabilize the architecture, APIs, and release process first. Once things settle, we’ll open the project up for contributions and document a clear workflow.

## What you *can* do right now

- **Report bugs:** Open a GitHub issue with:
  - steps to reproduce
  - expected vs actual behavior
  - logs/screenshots (redact tokens/secrets)
  - Docker details / CrossWatch version
- **Request features:** Open a GitHub issue describing:
  - the problem you’re trying to solve
  - your use case and expected outcome
  - any constraints (providers, sync modes, etc.)
- **Improve documentation:** You can suggest doc updates via issues (or discussions).

## Security issues

Please **do not** open public issues for security vulnerabilities. See `SECURITY.md` for private reporting instructions.

## Future contributions

When contributions open up, this file will be updated with:

- branch and PR guidelines
- coding style and linting rules
- test requirements
- release notes / changelog workflow
