# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to CrossWatch.

## Current status

CrossWatch is still early-stage and **we are not accepting external code contributions yet** (including pull requests).
We’re stabilizing the core architecture, APIs, and release process first.

## Plugin & app developers wanted (future)

I'm actively looking for people that can create:
- **Native plugins for media apps** (**Kodi**, **Stremio**, and similar)
- **Native mobile apps** for **Android** and **Apple (iOS/iPadOS)**

- Anything that can **interact with CrossWatch** (integration, triggers, status, sync actions, etc.)

Message me if you're one of these people. Thank you.

## Future contributions

When contributions open up, this file will be updated with:
- branch and PR guidelines
- coding style and linting rules
- test requirements
- release notes / changelog workflow
