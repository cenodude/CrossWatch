Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and sublicense, and to permit
persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the conditions
below.

The above copyright notice and this permission notice (including the additional
terms below) shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the
Software.

ADDITIONAL TERMS - COMMERCIAL USE RESTRICTION (INCLUDING HOSTED CONTAINERS)

1) Commercial use requires permission
Notwithstanding the permission grant above, you may not use, distribute,
sublicense, or make the Software available as part of any commercial product
or service where end users are required to pay (including subscriptions,
licenses, paywalls, or paid features) in order to access or use the Software,
unless you have explicit permission from the copyright holder.

Permission requests: contact on Discord: cenodude#2185

2) Hosted containers / container images (cost-only allowance)
If you provide the Software via a container image (such as Docker/OCI) and/or as a
hosted container deployment running the Software, you may charge ONLY the direct,
pass-through costs for hosting/infrastructure (such as compute, storage, bandwidth).

You may NOT charge for CrossWatch itself, bundle it into a paid plan, include it
as part of a subscription value proposition, add markup for the Software, or
otherwise price the service in a way that implies CrossWatch is included in the
price beyond hosting cost recovery.

This allowance does not remove the requirement to include the copyright notice
and this license text in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Rationale (informational; non-binding)
Life is expensive enough, and I built this application with love for the community.
CrossWatch will be free-for-ever.
