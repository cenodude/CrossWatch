# Code of Conduct

## 1. The Core Philosophy
* **Be kind. Be direct.** Efficiency is a virtue, but it shouldn't come at the cost of basic decency.
* **Assume good intent.** We are all here to build and learn. Start from a place of cooperation.
* **Boundaries are non-negotiable.** We do not tolerate "bad behavior," which includes harassment, sealioning, or aggressive demanding of others' time.

## 2. Anti-Entitlement Policy
This project is maintained by one volunteer, not a paid support staff. By participating here, you acknowledge the following:

* **No Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** This software is provided for free. We do not owe you a response, a feature, or a fix. 
* **You are not a "Customer":** If you approach this project with a sense of entitlement—demanding immediate attention or treating maintainers like your personal support agents—you will be asked to leave. 
* **Respect the Gift:** This is a "gift economy." If you want something changed, contribute a high-quality PR or ask politely. Threats, ultimatums, or "bossy" behavior will result in an immediate block.

---

## 3. The "AI-Neutral Zone"
I'm here to ship code, not to debate the merits of Artificial Intelligence. To keep the signal-to-noise ratio high, the following are prohibited:

* **AI Blaming & Griping:** Whether you love or loathe AI coding tools, keep the commentary out of this repository. We will not entertain discussions blaming "AI-ification" for bugs, nor will we host debates on the ethics of LLMs.
* **Tool Shaming:** We don't care if a line of code was written by a human, an AI, or a trained squirrel—as long as it works, follows our style guide, and is fully understood by the contributor. Shaming others for their choice of development tools is off-topic.
---

## 4. Communication Guidelines
* **Keep it Technical:** Discussions in Issues and PRs should remain focused on code, logic, and implementation. Take heated or meta-topics elsewhere.
* **Do the Work:** Before opening an issue, check the documentation and existing discussions. Respecting our time is the best way to get yours respected in return.
* **Ask Before Escalating:** If you are unsure about a project direction, ask for clarity before assuming the worst.

---
## 5. Enforcement
I reserve the right to:

1. Close issues that devolve into AI-bashing or tool-shaming without comment.
2. Lock threads that become unproductive, meta-heavy, or "entitled."
3. Ban users who exhibit toxic behavior or refuse to respect these boundaries.

> **Note:** If you find these terms restrictive, you are welcome to leave.
